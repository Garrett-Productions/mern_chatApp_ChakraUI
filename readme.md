- New library chakra UI
- 3 schemas using refs 
- Build in Vite
- I learned how to attach an image to my models which is key for my dive project also.
- Chakra UI is importing containers, a container based CSS library, for easy building 


npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion

- My small issue is the port when I have both front and back end
- Gonna go back to previous video  to make sure I set up my dotenv file port correctly
****Reconfiguring to build in CRA for sake of tutorial


Notes w Full Stack
- BackEnd on 5001, Front End on 3000 
- we added a proxy to the front end for cors 
- npm react-router-dom in client, wrapped our app in broweserRouter
